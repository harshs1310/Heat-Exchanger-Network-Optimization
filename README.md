# Process-Optimization
#### This repository demonstrates the application of mathematical programming techniques for optimizing processes. It provides python codes to solve the sample problems, utilizing LP models as a precursor to MILP & NLP formulations
**Problem Statement and Sample Data:**
#### Heat Exchanger network optimization
This project addresses process heat integration optimization by trying to minimize no. of Heat Exchangers required while meeting process constraints, hence reducing operations cost. A sample data file (`HEN-Optimization (Data).xlsx`) is included to illustrate the problem structure

#### Chemical Production optimization
This project addresses a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model implemented in Python to assist a company in making decisions related to the production of chemical C. The model aims to maximize profit by determining the optimal processes for manufacturing chemical C, obtaining chemical B, and deciding the production quantity.A sample data file (`Production-Optimization (Data).xlsx`) is included to illustrate the problem structure
