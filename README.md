# Heat-Exchanger-Network-Optimization
## This repository demonstrates the application of mathematical programming techniques for optimizing process heat integration. It provides python codes to solve the sample problem, utilizing LP transshipment model as a precursor to MILP & NLP formulations
## We will utilize Pyomo Librabry for problem formulation and solve it using different solver like - GLPK(For LP), Gurobi(For MILP ), IPOPT(For NLP)
