# Process-Optimization
#### This repository demonstrates the application of mathematical programming techniques for optimizing processes. It provides python codes to solve the sample problems, utilizing LP models as a precursor to MILP & NLP formulations
**Problem Statement and Sample Data:**
#### Heat Exchanger network optimization
This project addresses process heat integration optimization by trying to minimize no. of Heat Exchangers required while meeting process constraints, hence reducing operations cost. A sample data file (`HEN-Optimization (Data).xlsx`) is included to illustrate the problem structure
**Note:** The provided sample data is anonymized and may not reflect actual process conditions.
