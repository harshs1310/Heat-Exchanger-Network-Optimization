# Heat-Exchanger-Network-Optimization
### This repository demonstrates the application of mathematical programming techniques for optimizing process heat integration. It provides python codes to solve the sample problem, utilizing LP transshipment model as a precursor to MILP & NLP formulations
### We will utilize Pyomo Librabry for problem formulation and solve it using different solver like - GLPK(For LP), Gurobi(For MILP ), IPOPT(For NLP)
**Problem Statement and Sample Data:**

This project addresses process heat integration optimization. A sample data file (`HEN-Optimization (DaTa)`) is included to illustrate the problem structure and code usage: [Link to sample_data.xlsx](sample_data.xlsx)

**Note:** The provided sample data is anonymized and may not reflect actual process conditions.
